# 🚀 SpaceAI Desktop

**SpaceAI Desktop** is an application that wraps the official SpaceAI website into a seamless desktop experience.


## 📱 Why?

The original website is optimized exclusively for mobile devices. Unfortunately, it does not render well or provide an optimal experience when accessed from a standard desktop browser.


## 💡 Solution

This app forces the mobile version of the site into a fixed, responsive frame using a portable Chromium engine. The result is a stable and clean interface — directly on your desktop.
